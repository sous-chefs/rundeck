	<property>
		<name>hbase.rootdir</name>
		<value>hdfs://<%= @namenode %>:8020/hbase</value>
		<description>The directory shared by region servers.
		Should be fully-qualified to include the filesystem to use.
		E.g: hdfs://NAMENODE_SERVER:PORT/HBASE_ROOTDIR
		</description>
	</property>
	<property>
		<name>hbase.master.info.port</name>
		<value>60010</value>
		<description>The port for the hbase master web UI
		Set to -1 if you do not want the info server to run.
		</description>
	</property>
	<property>
		<name>hbase.cluster.distributed</name>
		<value>true</value>
		<description>The mode the cluster will be in. Possible values are
		false: standalone and pseudo-distributed setups with managed Zookeeper
		true: fully-distributed with unmanaged Zookeeper Quorum (see hbase-env.sh)
		</description>
	</property>
	<property>
		<name>hbase.zookeeper.property.clientPort</name>
		<value><%= node[:hbase][:site][:zookeeper_clientport] %></value>
		<description>Property from ZooKeeper's config zoo.cfg.
		The port at which the clients will connect.
		</description>
	</property>
	<property>
		<name>hbase.zookeeper.quorum</name>
		<value><%= node[:hbase][:site][:zookeeper_quorum] %></value>
		<description>Comma separated list of servers in the ZooKeeper Quorum.
		For example, "host1.mydomain.com,host2.mydomain.com,host3.mydomain.com".
		By default this is set to localhost for local and pseudo-distributed modes
		of operation. For a fully-distributed setup, this should be set to a full
		list of ZooKeeper quorum servers. If HBASE_MANAGES_ZK is set in hbase-env.sh
		this is the list of servers which we will start/stop ZooKeeper on.

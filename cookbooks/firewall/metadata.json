[80,443] to allow inbound HTTP & HTTPS). NOTE: `protocol` attribute is required with `ports`\n- port_range: range of incoming port numbers (ie. 60000..61000 to allow inbound mobile-shell. NOTE: `protocol` attribute is required with `port_range`\n- source: ip address or subnet to filter on incoming traffic. default is `0.0.0.0/0` (ie Anywhere)\n- destination: ip address or subnet to filter on outgoing traffic.\n- dest_port: outgoing port number.\n- position: position to insert rule at. if not provided rule is inserted at the end of the rule list.\n- direction: direction of the rule. valid values are: :in, :out, default is :in\n- interface: interface to apply rule (ie. 'eth0').\n- logging: may be added to enable logging for a particular rule. valid values are: :connections, :packets. In the ufw provider, :connections logs new connections while :packets logs all packets.\n\n### Providers\n\n- `Chef::Provider::FirewallRuleUfw`\n    - platform default: Ubuntu\n\n### Examples\n\n    # open standard ssh port, enable firewall\n    firewall_rule \"ssh\" do\n      port 22\n      action :allow\n      notifies :enable, \"firewall[ufw]\"\n    end\n\n    # open standard http port to tcp traffic only; insert as first rule\n    firewall_rule \"http\" do\n      port 80\n      protocol :tcp\n      position 1\n      action :allow\n    end\n\n    # restrict port 13579 to 10.0.111.0/24 on eth0\n    firewall_rule \"myapplication\" do\n      port 13579\n      source '10.0.111.0/24'\n      direction :in\n      interface 'eth0'\n      action :allow\n    end\n\n    # open UDP ports 60000..61000 for mobile shell (mosh.mit.edu), note\n    # that the protocol attribute is required when using port_range\n    firewall_rule \"mosh\" do\n      protocol :udp\n      port_range 60000..61000\n      action :allow\n    end\n\n    # open multiple ports for http/https, note that the protocol\n    # attribute is required when using ports\n    firewall_rule \"http/https\" do\n      protocol :tcp\n      ports [ 80, 443 ]\n      action :allow\n    end\n\n    firewall \"ufw\" do\n      action :nothing\n    end\n\nLicense and Author\n==================\n\nAuthor:: Seth Chisamore (<schisamo@opscode.com>)\n\nCopyright:: Copyright (c) 2011 Opscode, Inc.\n\nLicensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\");\nyou may not use this file except in compliance with the License.\nYou may obtain a copy of the License at\n\n    http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0\n\nUnless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software\ndistributed under the License is distributed on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\nWITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.\nSee the License for the specific language governing permissions and\nlimitations under the License.\n",
